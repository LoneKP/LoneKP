      <description>I have created Brainstormer to make it easier for YOU to facilitate brainstorms.
 Maybe you tried it out, and something is not quite fitting with how you would like to brainstorm.
 Well, let&amp;rsquo;s just create the tool as you would like it! There are several ways to how you can be a part of that.
 Contributing Brainstormer is open for everyone to contribute to. If you want to take part, you can find the repository on GitHub.</description>

      <description>Brainstormer is all about ideas. And I am sure that everybody who uses Brainstormer has plenty of them.
 I want to invite everyone to join the development of this project.
 There are two ways for that to happen:
 Help plan what should be developed next, and develop it! Get the code and start remixing it to fit your own needs. You - are free to host your remixed project somewhere else as long as you also make your changes open source.</description>

      <description>Hi 👋
 I&amp;rsquo;m Lone, and I am the maker of this tool.
 I reside in Copenhagen, where I work with product management. In that role, I often facilitate different kinds of creative processes, which is something I really enjoy!
 During the covid-19 lockdown, when everything suddenly had to be online, I realized how much extra effort you have to put into remote facilitation, and I wanted to do something about it!</description>
