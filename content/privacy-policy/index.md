Let us go through which data footprint you leave by using Brainstormer, and how your data is treated and stored!

&nbsp;

### Your data

When you use brainstormer your **IP address** is saved temporarily, but maximum 6 months. With your IP address you’re letting me know from where in the world you are using Brainstormer, and learning the demographics of Brainstormer’s users is the only reason I store your IP address temporarily.

&nbsp;
 
When you choose to send your ideas by email at the end of the brainstorming session, **your email address** is saved as a contact on the Brainstormer Google Gmail, which is used to send out those emails. 

&nbsp;

I will not use your email for anything at all besides sending you that one email with your generated ideas.

&nbsp;

### Your usage data

I try to understand how you use Brainstormer, by tracking which buttons you click when you use Brainstormer. I do that only to understand how useful the features I built are to you. Based on what I learn, I try to come up with improvements and new features. 

&nbsp;

### Where is your data stored?

I use Heroku to host the Brainstormer app. Heroku is, as you can read in their [security policy](https://www.heroku.com/policy/security), committed to keeping customers' data safe. 

&nbsp;

Brainstormer uses a Postgres database to store your IP address temporarily and your usage data. This database is hosted on Amazon Web Services on a data center located in Europe.
