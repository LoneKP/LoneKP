If you want to help keep Brainstormer running you can now [support with a small amount](https://buy.stripe.com/14k2a74Ns2SocaAbII). :revolving_hearts:

&nbsp;

Every little contribution counts, and I am forever grateful for every contribution! 🙏🙏🙏

&nbsp;

I ask this only because I don't want to annoy you with ads and I want to keep Brainstormer free to use for everyone.

&nbsp;

Your contribution will be spent on keeping the lights on 💡 and fueling me 🙋‍♀️ with coffee ☕ so I can build new cool features.

&nbsp;

Best regards,\
Lone Kjeldgaard
