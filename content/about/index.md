Hi :wave:

&nbsp;

I'm Lone, and I am the maker of this tool.

&nbsp;

I reside in Copenhagen, where I work with product management. In that role, I often facilitate different kinds of creative processes, which is something I really enjoy!

&nbsp;
 
During the covid-19 lockdown, when everything suddenly had to be online, I realized how much extra effort you have to put into remote facilitation, and I wanted to do something about it!

&nbsp;

I decided to make a tool that facilitators would love! 😍

&nbsp;

What I wanted to achieve was to: 

- make it really easy to get started - you should be able to start brainstorming in the blink of an eye 👁️
- make the whole process tailored - you shouldn't spend too much time thinking about how to facilitate a session, but rather focus on what you want to do 🚀
- make the experience of brainstorming light and fun - the best ideas come when people are having a good time 🎉

What do you think? 💖

&nbsp;

If you haven't already, go ahead and [create a new brainstorm](https://www.app.brainstormer.online/brainstorms/new) 🧠

&nbsp;

And don't forget to [let me know what I can do to improve Brainstormer](mailto:brainstormer.online@gmail.com).

Best regards,\
Lone Kjeldgaard
