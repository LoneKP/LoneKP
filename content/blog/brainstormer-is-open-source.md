Brainstormer is all about ideas. And I am sure that everybody who uses Brainstormer has plenty of them.

&nbsp;

I want to invite everyone to join the development of this project.

&nbsp;

There are two ways for that to happen:

- Help plan what should be developed next, and develop it!
- Get the code and start remixing it to fit your own needs. You - are free to host your remixed project somewhere else as long as you also make your changes open source.

&nbsp;

You can find the source code and more about how to contribute at [GitHub](https://github.com/LoneKP/brainstormer) (you will need to create a GitHub account)

&nbsp;

If you have any questions, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:brainstormer.online@gmail.com).
