A user of brainstormer asked me, if she could host a brainstorm, but have ideas coming in over a week.

&nbsp;

At first I thought that this is not exactly what I built the tool for, but I actually had a use case of my own in mind, so why not try it out. 

&nbsp;

### Brainstorm ideas for Brainstormer!

For a while, I have been thinking about, how to make it easy as a brainstormer to submit suggestions for improvements and report bugs. 

&nbsp;

And maybe the perfect answer is to have an ongoing, open brainstorm where everyone can add feedback whenever!

&nbsp;

So, I decided to implement it üèóÔ∏è 

&nbsp;

You can participate in the ongoing brainstorm through this link:

### How to make a brainstorm with no timer?

&nbsp;

So - how does this new feature work?

&nbsp;

It's very easy to make a brainstorm without a timer. You just drag the slider all the way to the end, and you will get a brainstorm session that never ends!

And that's all. Happy brainstorming!
