Maybe you tried it out, and something is not quite fitting with how you would like to brainstorm.
Well, let&amp;rsquo;s just create the tool as you would like it! There are several ways to how you can be a part of that.
Contributing Brainstormer is open for everyone to contribute to. If you want to take part, you can find the repository on GitHub.</description></item><item><title>BRAINSTORMER IS OPEN SOURCE! 🎉</title><link>https://www.blog.brainstormer.online/brainstormer-is-open-source/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2021 12:54:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.blog.brainstormer.online/brainstormer-is-open-source/</guid><description>Brainstormer is all about ideas. And I am sure that everybody who uses Brainstormer has plenty of them.
I want to invite everyone to join the development of this project.
There are two ways for that to happen:
Help plan what should be developed next, and develop it! Get the code and start remixing it to fit your own needs. You - are free to host your remixed project somewhere else as long as you also make your changes open source.</description></item><item><title>Brainstormers around the world 🌏</title><link>https://www.blog.brainstormer.online/brainstormers-around-the-world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.blog.brainstormer.online/brainstormers-around-the-world/</guid><description>Reviews, video tutorials and articles about Brainstormer are popping up.

At first I thought that this is not exactly what I built the tool for, but I actually had a use case of my own in mind, so why not try it out.
Brainstorm ideas for Brainstormer! For a while, I have been thinking about, how to make it easy as a brainstormer to submit suggestions for improvements and report bugs.</description></item></channel></rss>
