Â I&amp;rsquo;m Lone, and I am the maker of this tool.
Â I reside in Copenhagen, where I work with product management. In that role, I often facilitate different kinds of creative processes, which is something I really enjoy!
Â During the covid-19 lockdown, when everything suddenly had to be online, I realized how much extra effort you have to put into remote facilitation, and I wanted to do something about it!</description></item></channel></rss>
